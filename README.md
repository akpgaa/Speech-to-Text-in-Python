SPEECH TO TEXT

INTRODUCTION: 
Speech is the most common means of communication and the majority of the population in the world relies on speech to communicate with one another. Speech recognition systems basically translate spoken languages into text. There are various real-life examples of speech recognition systems. For example, Apple SIRI, Google Voice Assistant which recognizes the speech and truncates it into text.


REQUIREMENTS 

Python 3.7.3
“PyAudio”Library
This Python library is used for audio input/output operations through the microphone and speaker. It will help to get our voice through the microphone.
Several Speech recognition engine/API support[2]:
CMU Sphinx (works offline)
Google Speech Recognition
Google Cloud Speech API
Wit.ai
Microsoft Bing Voice Recognition
Houndify API
IBM Speech to Text
Snowboy Hotword Detection (works offline)

I’m going to use Google Speech-To-Text API. It isn't free, however. It is free for speech recognition for audio less than 60 minutes. 


PROCEDURE
Step 1: Execute the below command in your command prompt to install a “Speech Recognition” API in Python. Before installation you will verify your Python version, which is  “Python 3.7.3”
pip install SpeechRecognition 

Step 2: We need to install PyAudio library which used to receive audio input and output through the microphone and speaker. Basically, it helps to get our voice through the microphone. (refer in such case you got error)
pip install PyAudio
Step 3 :  Run the code (https://github.com/akpgaa/Speech-to-Text-in-Python.git)
Note : Audio file supports by speech recognition: wav, AIFF, AIFF-C, FLAC.
